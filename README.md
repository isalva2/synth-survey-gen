# Synthetic Survey Generation

*"The original fun of the show to us was these crazy colorful looking characters, almost like aliens, they're just weird looking. They're just real that's the joke, like they blink and they have heart problems and they have ADD. There's no joke they're just talking, and they're just really arguing."*

This is a two part project consisting of:
1. Population Synthesis
2. Travel demand inference obtained from generative AI.
