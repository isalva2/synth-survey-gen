# Synthetic Travel Survey Data Generation

Accurate and contextually relevant travel surveys are essential for robust travel demand modeling, yet the design and undertaking of high-quality travel surveys remains time-intensive and requires significant financial commitment by the metropolitan areas that wish to conduct them. This study explores the use of large language model (LLM)-enhanced agents to generate survey data as a means of complimenting existing travel surveys, and to supplant them entirely for regions that do not have access to the resources to conduct a travel survey.

By incorporating prompt engineering, an integrated memory system, and grounded agent profiles that are temporally and contextually aware, LLM-enhances agents can produce realistic survey responses regarding key travel demand parameters such as mode choice, trip activity type, and the number and sequence of trips throughout the day. Furthermore, the use of LLM-agents can provide not only survey response data, but insight into the reasons and thought processes behind individual travel behavior, a valuable source of information not captured by the traditional survey format.

We evaluate the quality, relevance, and diversity of LLM-generated survey responses against cultural and geographic contexts by replicating and assessing against historic travel surveys in Lyon, France and in Chicago, Illinois in the United States. Our findings indicate that a synthesized population of LLM-enhanced agents can generate realistic and contextually aware survey responses, and can be used to support rapid scenario testing for emergent travel behaviors (e.g., micro-mobility, remote work) and response to system wide disturbances (i.e. extreme weather and climate phenomena or pandemic response). The integration of LLM-enhanced agents into travel demand surveys offers a promising pathway for modernizing and improving the responsiveness of travel demand models, and as a precursor for the future integration of LLM-enhanced agents in an activity-based travel demand modeling platform.

## Overview

This is a Python based LLM  project that uses the [Langroid](https://langroid.github.io/langroid/) framework for agent implementation and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as the self-hosted LLM back-end. More infromation will be added as progress continues.
