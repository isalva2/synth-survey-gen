She mentioned she's a 36-year-old woman living in Will County, Illinois, and describes herself as middles class.\\n\\nFirst, the age part is straightforward because she directly states she's 36. That should be easy enough. The middle class classification is more about understanding where she fits economically but doesn't affect her age.\\n\\nI don't think there are any indirect clues here that would change her age from what she said. She didn't provide any other information that might suggest a different age, so I can confidently go with 36.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe question asks for Jennifer Wilson's age based on her description as a 36-year-old woman.\\n\\n**Answer:**  \\nnumber: 36\"},\n",
