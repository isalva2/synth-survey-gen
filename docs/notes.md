# Outline
- Transportation research must balance individual complexity with simplified system models.
- LLMs can act as dynamic travel behavior agents, offering richer behavior than rule-based models.

## Travel Behavior
- Travel behavior reflects how people organize trips, shaped by constraints and geography.
- Frameworks like Van Acker’s and PDMD highlight roles of perceptions, attitudes, and values.

## Capturing Travel Behavior
- The NHTS provides national travel data, with local surveys like CMAP’s for more detail.
- Survey sample rates have fallen, e.g., Chicago’s survey covered only 0.04% of residents.
- Developing countries face added survey issues from access limits and cultural barriers.
- U.S. surveys underrepresent disadvantaged groups; new sampling and data modes are needed.

## Big Issues
- Travel surveys remain essential for activity-based models but miss atypical events.
- Reliance on historical data limits predictions for new trends like telework or micromobility.
- Current LLM use is narrow, often replicating simpler ML tools without added benefit.

## LLM Travel Behavior Agents
- LLM agents can role-play travelers, generating synthetic, adaptive, and context-aware data.
- Studies have used LLMs for forecasting, imputation, and zero-shot mode choice.
- These uses underexploit LLMs’ generative and agent-like potential.
- A proposed framework casts LLMs as simulated individuals with realistic profiles.

## LLM Intro
- LLMs are probabilistic language models built on transformer architectures.
- Trained on vast data, they enable few-shot, zero-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
