# A Perspective on Large Language Model (LLM) Applications in the Transportation Research Space

Those in the transportation research community are tasked with a paradoxical challenge: they must capture the unique, often erratic, travel behavior of individuals while also abstracting these behaviors onto models that apply at a collective scale. On one hand, researchers must contend with quantifying the abstract, often seemingly irrational, choices made by individuals as they travel. On the other hand, they must translate these heterogeneous, chaotic behaviors into well-behaved, closed-form inputs, rules, and assumptions, for modeling at scale to yield any meaningful conclusions. These concessions are made for a variety of reasons, including the needs for analytical tractability, computational feasibility, and compliance with well-established theoretical frameworks. Lost in the process is the true nature of individual travel behavior, obfuscated in the integration of existing modeling pipelines that prioritize operational research objectives rather than the true complexity of individual travel behavior. Naturally, the question arises: can the weight of humanity's decision making (at least with respect to travel) be reduced to near, formulaic abstractions? If we hope to understand and influence travel behavior in a meaningful way, the field must embrace a new paradigm, one that places the individual, in all their unpredictability and irrationality, at the center of our models.

A contender for this is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as simulated individuals (or agents) in a travel demand context. Contemporary transportation research has so far largely adopted LLMs in a limited capacity, often treating these large models as black-box predictors or domain experts that provide high-level insights or demand forecasts. This use treats LLMs as static tools, relegated to analysis applications that lack behavioral nuance and do little more than what simpler, faster, machine learning models can already achieve. In contrast, LLM agents, simulated individuals, are autonomous, distinctly unique entities powered by LLMs that are capable of reasoning over multiple steps, maintaining internal state, and using external tools, offering a more compelling use of a powerful generative tool. Rather than asking an LLM to describe or predict travel behavior from a top-down, system-wide perspective, an LLM agent can inhabit the role of a traveler, responding to travel demand phenomena within a dynamic context. This approach more naturally aligns with the behavioral structure of traveling individuals, and an ideal foundation to extract macroscopic phenomena with a more representative view of reality.
